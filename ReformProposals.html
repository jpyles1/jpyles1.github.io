<h2>Reform Proposals</h2>
<p>The ECPA embodies many important and useful protections but has changed a lot since 1986. ECPA regulates when eletronic communications <br>can be intercepted, monitored, or reviewed by third party, making its a crime to get this communication unless they have a court order or an <br>exception to ECPA. The adoption of cloud computing offers many benefits but mke the need for reform more urgent. Since most communication <br>is stored on a home server its protected by the fourth amendment, this does not work for remote servers.</p>

<h2>Current Proposals</h2>
<h4>Email Privacy Act of 2016</h4>
<p>Representative Kevin Yoder introduced this act in 2015. This proposal includes an extension of the warrant requirement to communications <br>stored for more than 180 days and a notice before email searchers. This act was passed in the house in 2016 but left out the notice requirement.</p>
<h4>Emergency Authorization Provision</h4>
<p>Senator Jeff Sessions proposed an emergency disclosure rule to the act which would give an exemption to the warrant requirements in times of <br>claimed emergency. Under the current act, companies are allowed to voluntarily make emergency disclosures, but the amendment would make it mandatory.</p>
<h4>Electronic Communications Transactional Records</h4>
<p>Senator Lindsey Graham proposed a "fix" to ECPA which would grant the FBI access to browsing history and location information with <br>a National Security Letter (NSL). These letters are issued directly by local FBI offices without any court approval or supervision. </p>
